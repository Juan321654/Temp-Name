## API and Data Sample

https://openweathermap.org/current

Sample JSON:
```json
{
    "coord": {
        "lon": -73.92,
        "lat": 40.83
    },
    "weather": [
        {
            "id": 803,
            "main": "Clouds",
            "description": "broken clouds",
            "icon": "04d"
        }
    ],
    "base": "stations",
    "main": {
        "temp": 301.4,
        "feels_like": 299.47,
        "temp_min": 300.37,
        "temp_max": 302.59,
        "pressure": 1016,
        "humidity": 48
    },
    "visibility": 10000,
    "wind": {
        "speed": 5.7,
        "deg": 50
    },
```

## Wireframes

#### MVP 

- choose a city
- choose between Fahrenheit and Celsius
- display weather conditions such as humidy, cloudy etc.

#### PostMVP  

- make the background change to warm or cool colors depending on the temp
- make transition effect when clicking F to C
- make a transition to the background when changing colors
- make text color change according to temp
- make city, icon, temp, description, conditions fade in when called.

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|August 14-16| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|August 17| Project Approval | Incomplete
|August 18| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|August 19| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|August 20| MVP | Incomplete
|August 21| Presentations | Incomplete

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
